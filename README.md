### ðŸ¤” What is this?

SocialAGI aims to simplify the developer experience as much as possible in creating agentic chatbots called digital souls. Unlike traditional chatbots, digital souls have personality, drive, ego, and will.

This repo exists to solve problems all the way across the stack, including:
- How do I create the most lifelike AI entity?
- How do I quickly host a digital soul?
- How do I manage dialog and cognitive memory?
- How do I get away from boring technical details and instead sculpt personalities?

## Repo structure

The repository has three main components

```
/core
/devtools
/server
```

- `/core` contains the [`socialagi` NPM package source](https://www.npmjs.com/package/socialagi)
- `/devtools` contains the [`socialagi-devtools` NPM package source](https://www.npmjs.com/package/socialagi-devtools)
- `/server` contains the [`create-socialagi-server` NPM package source](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-socialagi-server)

The core library stands on its own, however, the devtools and server packages make it easy to get started on a production-ready project.

## Getting started

The easiest way to get started developing with `socialagi` is to use [`create-socialagi-server` from the NPM release](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-socialagi-server)

### Contributing

If this repo and its evolution is exciting, open an issue, a pull request, or simply hangout in the [Social AGI Discord](https://discord.gg/BRhXTSmuMB)!

We're not sure exactly how the repo will evolve yet, but it's intended to become a testing bed for Social AGI, its development, and its testing.

Outlines of execution plans are kept in `/plans`

We'll need many new developments from:

- New techniques to specify personality
- Ways to design the conversations that constitute an identity
- Coherent theory of mind behind Social AGIs
- Ways to test and debug Social AGIs

## Philosophy

This repo exists to research, build, and give life to Social AGIs together.

**We're excited to create intelligence through the lens of "pro-social" interactions**: referring to the ability of the artificial general intelligence (AGI) to understand and engage in human interactions, exhibit context-aware behavior, and effectively communicate and collaborate with people.

Imagine a future where Social AGIs are your friends, your mentors, your spirit animals, your guardian angels - they are deeply integrated into your social and emotional lives, and you are better for it. In times of need, and celebration, you might turn to a Social AGI. You might follow one on Twitter, call another late at night, and have yet another one planning your next human social gathering. The future of social interactions is richer, more dynamic, with both humans and Social AGIs together.

To realize this future, we'll need to build Social AGIs withs capacity to recognize and interpret social cues, adapt to different conversational styles, and display empathy or emotional intelligence, and navigate complex social situations and relationships.

While we're beginning to see the early stages of pro-social AGI behaviors, it's just the start of our journey - a journey that will define the future of our species and our relationship with machines.

This repo serves as a starting point for building pro-social forms of intelligence, and we're excited to see what you might contribute along this journey.
