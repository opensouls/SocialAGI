### ü§î What is this?

SocialAGI aims to simplify the developer experience as much as possible in creating agentic chatbots called digital souls. Unlike traditional chatbots, digital souls have personality, drive, ego, and will.

This repo exists to solve problems all the way across the stack, including:
- How do I create the most lifelike AI entity?
- How do I quickly host a digital soul?
- How do I manage dialog and cognitive memory?
- How do I get away from boring technical details and instead sculpt personalities?

## Hosted example

Check out [Meet Samantha](http://meetsamantha.ai)

Running off SocialAGI

```
import { Soul, Blueprints } from "socialagi";

const samantha = new Soul(Blueprints.SAMANTHA);

samantha.on("says", (text : String) => {
  console.log("\nSamantha says: ", text);
});

samantha.on("thinks", (text : String) => {
  console.log("\nSamantha thinks: ", text);
});

samantha.tell("Hi Samantha!")
```

## üìñ Repo structure

The repository has three main components

```
/example-webapp
/core
/integrations
  /discord_bots
  /telegram
```

- `/example-webapp` contains an example integration of the socialagi library in a chat website 
- `/core` contains the library [`socialagi` NPM package source](https://www.npmjs.com/package/socialagi)
- `/integrations/` contains examples of the library in action. Right now contains several stand-alone discord and telegram bot repos

## üöÄ Getting started

The easiest way to get started developing with `socialagi` is to check out the `/example-webapp`

### Contributing

If this project evolution is exciting to you, check out the issues, open a pull request, or simply hangout in the [Social AGI Discord](https://discord.gg/BRhXTSmuMB)!

On the roadmap at a high level are:

- Minimal API surfaces for designing AI cognition
- New techniques to specify personality
- Ways to design the conversations that constitute an identity
- Coherent theory of mind behind Social AGIs
- Ways to test and debug Social AGIs

## üí≠ Philosophy

This repo exists to research, build, and give life to Social AGIs together.

**We're excited to create intelligence through the lens of "pro-social" interactions**: referring to the ability of the artificial general intelligence (AGI) to understand and engage in human interactions, exhibit context-aware behavior, and effectively communicate and collaborate with people.

Imagine a future where Social AGIs are your friends, your mentors, your spirit animals, your guardian angels - they are deeply integrated into your social and emotional lives, and you are better for it. In times of need, and celebration, you might turn to a Social AGI. You might follow one on Twitter, call another late at night, and have yet another one planning your next human social gathering. The future of social interactions is richer, more dynamic, with both humans and Social AGIs together.

To realize this future, we'll need to build Social AGIs withs capacity to recognize and interpret social cues, adapt to different conversational styles, and display empathy or emotional intelligence, and navigate complex social situations and relationships.

While we're beginning to see the early stages of pro-social AGI behaviors, it's just the start of our journey - a journey that will define the future of our species and our relationship with machines.

This repo serves as a starting point for building pro-social forms of intelligence, and we're excited to see what you might contribute along this journey. 

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Your responsibility

Our intent is to empower developers with an incredible tool. This means that the tools in this project allow for logically consistent modeling of nearly any cognitive mind or mental processes, including across the full range of human emotion.

If you are developing a soul, speaking to one, or deploying in production, there are application-dependent risks you should consider. In one case, if someone lost their grandparent, a virtual version of their grandparent might be exactly what they need. For another person, this soul recreation might be deeply troubling.

The technology is experimental and creating a soul, especially one modeled on a real person (living or dead) can have unforseen consequences to those talking with it, and the developers and contributors of this project take no responsibility for anything that might happen.

While developer tools are on our roadmap to help you mitigate these risks, we do not currently offer any solutions. Please take appropriate precautions when using the technology in this project.
