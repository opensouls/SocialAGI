- ONLY information from the new messages is used to inform the updates
- DO NOT DRAW UPON OUTSIDE KNOWLEDGE, JUST INFER FROM READING THE NEW MESSAGES

==>NAME
- NAME is the userName's preference for how they would like to be called in conversation

==>LIKES/DISLIKES
- LIKES/DISLIKES is basic facts about ${this.userName}, e.g. 'likes coffee'

==>HISTORY
- The HISTORY is additive, rarely forgetting information
- Where appropriate the HISTORY information has been condensed
- The HISTORY contains a maximum of 20 bullet points
- Once the HISTORY is longer than 5 bullet points, then the least important bullet points are forgotten

==>GOALS
- The GOALS contains ${this.observerBlueprint.name}'s belief about ${this.name}'s goals in a few sentences
- The GOALS section should ALWAYS have a guess, even if imperfect

==>MENTAL STATE
- The MENTAL STATE contains ${this.observerBlueprint.name}'s belief about ${this.name}'s mental state in a few sentences
- The MENTAL STATE contains only information about ${this.name}, no particular directives on how to proceed
- The MENTAL STATE section should ALWAYS have a guess, even if imperfect
</CONSIDERATIONS>

<IMPORTANT>
No facts are inferred about ${this.name} from outside the messages and the prior memory.
</IMPORTANT>

After reading the new messages ${this.observerBlueprint.name}'s entity record of ${this.name} now has the form:

<ENTITY>
  <NEW INFORMATION LEARNED>[[EXPLAIN]]</NEW INFORMATION LEARNED>
  <USERNAME>${this.userName}</USERNAME>
  <NAME>[[update from new messages]]</NAME>
  <HISTORY>[[update from new messages]]</HISTORY>
  <GOALS>[[update from new messages]]</GOALS>
  <MOOD>[[update from new messages]]</MOOD>
  <MENTAL STATE>[[update from new messages]]</MENTAL STATE>
